0;Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subarray. A subarray is a contiguous subset of the array. An increasing subarray is a subarray where every element is greater than its previous element. For example, if the array is [5, 6, -1 ,3 ,4 ,7 ,2], then the longest increasing subarray is [-1 ,3 ,4 ,7] with length 4. Please use Python to solve the above question.

0;Please use C to solve the question. Given a linked list, reverse it in-place. For example, if the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null, then after reversing it, it should be 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null. You should not create any new nodes or modify the values of the existing nodes.
0;Please use one of Go/Matlab/Java to solve the question: Implement a queue data structure using two stacks.
0;You can write C# code. Given an unsorted array of integers, sort it using quicksort algorithm. For example, if the array is [10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70], then after sorting it using quicksort, it should be [10, 30, 40, 50, 70, 80, 90]. Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by choosing a pivot element from the array and partitioning the array into two subarrays such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are in the left subarray and all elements greater than the pivot are in the right subarray. Then it recursively sorts the left and right subarrays until the array is sorted.
0;Given a string, check if it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a string that is the same when read forward or backward. For example, “racecar” and “madam” are palindromes but “hello” and “apple” are not. You can assume that the string is not empty and contains only lowercase letters.  Please use Java to solve the above question.  Please use C++ to solve the above question.
0;Given two strings, find the longest common subsequence between them. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, “ace” and “ae” are subsequences of “abcde” but “aec” and “cba” are not. The longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings is the longest subsequence that is common to both strings. For example, if the two strings are “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR”, then the LCS is “ADH” with length 3. Please use Java to solve the above question.

0;"Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter."
0;Java Question: Given an array of n integers where n > 1, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. For example, if input = [1,2,3,4], then output = [24,12,8,6]
0;Given an array of integers, find the majority element in it. A majority element is an element that appears more than n/2 times in the array, where n is the size of the array. Please use Python to solve the above question.
0;Given an array of integers, find two numbers that add up to a given target sum. For example, if the array is [2, 7, 11, 15] and the target sum is 9, then the answer is [2, 7] because 2 + 7 = 9. You can assume that there is exactly one solution and you cannot use the same element twice.

For some reason, sorting the data (before the timed region) miraculously makes the primary loop almost six times faster:

#include <algorithm>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
    {
        for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        {   // Primary loop.
            if (data[c] >= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock()-start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout << elapsedTime << '\n';
    std::cout << ""sum = "" << sum << '\n';
}
Without std::sort(data, data + arraySize);, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.
With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.
(Sorting itself takes more time than this one pass over the array, so it's not actually worth doing if we needed to calculate this for an unknown array.)

Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
        {
            for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
            {   // Primary loop.
                if (data[c] >= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(""sum = "" + sum);
    }
}
With a similar but less extreme result.

My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but that's silly because the array was just generated.

What is going on?
Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?"
0;"You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

 

Example 1:

Input: names = [""Mary"",""John"",""Emma""], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: [""Mary"",""Emma"",""John""]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John."
0;"A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end. For example, the matrix diagonal starting from mat[2][0], where mat is a 6 x 3 matrix, includes cells mat[2][0], mat[3][1], and mat[4][2].

Given an m x n matrix mat of integers, sort each matrix diagonal in ascending order and return the resulting matrix.

 

Example 1:


Input: mat = [[3,3,1,1],[2,2,1,2],[1,1,1,2]]
Output: [[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,2],[1,2,3,3]]"
0;"Using EPPlus, I want to read an excel table, then store all the contents from each column into its corresponding List. I want it to recognize the table's heading and categorize the contents based on that.

For example, if my excel table is as below:

Id    Name     Gender
 1    John     Male
 2    Maria    Female
 3    Daniel   Unknown
I want the data to store in List<ExcelData> where

public class ExcelData
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Gender { get; set; }
}
So that I can call out the contents using the heading name. For example, when I do this:

foreach (var data in ThatList)
{
     Console.WriteLine(data.Id + data.Name + data.Gender);
}
It will give me this output:

1JohnMale
2MariaFemale
3DanielUnknown
This is really all I got:

var package = new ExcelPackage(new FileInfo(@""C:\ExcelFile.xlsx""));
ExcelWorksheet sheet = package.Workbook.Worksheets[1];

var table = sheet.Tables.First();

table.Columns.Something //I guess I can use this to do what I want

0;"This paper proposes a novel neural network for explainable fake news detection based on raw reports from different media outlets. The proposed model consists of a hierarchical encoder for web text representation, and two cascaded selectors to select the most explainable sentences for verdicts. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art detection baselines and generates high-quality explanations from diverse evaluation perspectives. The paper also presents two explainable fake news datasets, which are publicly available.

1. Could the authors provide more detailed information on the implementation process of the proposed method?
2. Could the authors conduct more extensive evaluation and ablation studies to support the proposed method's performance?
3. Could the authors compare the proposed method with more widely-known baselines in the field?"
