1;"In our computer systems lecture we were introduced to the MIPS processor. It was (re)developed over the course of the term and has in fact been quite easy to understand. It uses a RISC design, that is its elementary commands are regularly encoded and there are only few of them in order to keep the wires simple.
It was mentioned that CISC follows a different philosophy. I looked briefly at the x86 instruction set and was shocked. I can not image how anyone would want to build a processor that uses so complex a command set!
So I figure there have to be good arguments why large portions of the processor market use CISC architectures. What are they?"

0;"Slater type orbitals (STO) are considered to be more accurate than gaussian type orbitals (GTO) for atomic and molecular QM calculations because - among other reasons - they decay with $e^{-\alpha r}$ as $r \to \infty$. But GTOs are more popular because they are easier to calculate with. GTOs decay with $e^{-\alpha r^2}$, so its adequate to sometimes add diffuse functions to the GTO basis set to compensate for gaussian decay behaviour.
Also, exact hydrogen wavefunctions decay exponentially, so the motivation for STOs.
I understand that the only boundary requirement for solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for atoms and molecules in free space is that the wavefunction goes zero as $r \to \infty$, but there are no a priori requirements for the way it decays as it does so.
My question is: do we have theoretical (ab initio) and/or experimental reasons to believe that all atomic and molecular wavefunctions decay like $e^{-\alpha r}$ as $r \to \infty$."

By different people I mean the advisor, graduate students and PhD students.
I know it mainly depends on the job description but there are few basic things that a postdoc must be expected to do. How aggressive (proactive) must one be? This question is important since a postdoc cannot just wait for the adviser to give him/her inputs.

* What preparation one must do to rise to the expected level?

> Trained Olympic lifters, for example, were shown over a two-year period to have significant strength increases with barely noticeable increases in muscle mass (Hakkinen et al, 1988). I had a similar experience when I used AST's Max-OT principals. My strength went up like crazy, but I gained very little size.

0;"I have a page where a scroll bar containing table rows with divs in them is dynamically generated from the database. Each table row acts like a link, sort of like you'd see on a YouTube playlist next to the video player.
When a user visits the page, the option they are on is supposed to go to the top of the scrolling div. This functionality is working. The issue is that it goes just a tad too far. Like the option they are on is about 10px too high. So, the page is visited, the url is used to identify which option was selected and then scrolls that option to the top of the scrolling div. Note: This is not the scroll bar for the window, it is a div with a scrollbar.

```var pathArray = window.location.pathname.split( '/' );

el.scrollIntoView(true);

For example, you have an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten. You call your hand and say, &quot;I have a Straight!&quot;
But that was a bad move on your part because you are a novice player and you did not notice that all of your cards are Spades. You actually had a Straight Flush, but now you have lost because one of the remaining players had a Full House.

One of the advantages (for the parser, at least) for a ```fun``` keyword is that it lets the parser be context-free (it doesn't have to guess if ```int``` defines a variable or if it defines a function).
When C was invented, computers had very little memory and speed (so little, that the reason C requires one to define all the variables in the beginning of the function was because it had to be a one-pass parser). Why didn't they choose the simple way out and use function defining keyword?"

* Clarity about what has to be done and when

1;"When reading some documentation about the security of a product, I found that the vendor uses the SHA-2 of a password to encrypt data (AES-256), instead of using this password directly.
Are there any advantages of doing so?
An attacker is not going to crack the encrypted data using this SHA-2-as-a-password key but rather exhaust the password keyspace (if feasible) and try its hash. Therefore the only reason I can think of is that there is an extra computational step (the creation of the hash). I would have rather increased the password entropy if the point is to computationally complexify the attack."

0;"In Android, I defined an ```ImageView```'s ```layout_width``` to be ```fill_parent``` (which takes up the full width of the phone).
If the image I put to ```ImageView``` is bigger than the ```layout_width```, Android will scale it, right? But what about the height? When Android scales the image, will it keep the aspect ratio?
What I find out is that there is some white space at the top and bottom of the ```ImageView``` when Android scales an image which is bigger than the ```ImageView```. Is that true? If yes, how can I eliminate that white space?"
0;I want to compare 2 arrays of objects in JavaScript code.  The objects have 8 total properties, but each object will not have a value for each, and the arrays are never going to be any larger than 8 items each, so maybe the brute force method of traversing each and then looking at the values of the 8 properties is the easiest way to do what I want to do, but before implementing, I wanted to see if anyone had a more elegant solution. Any thoughts?
0;"I'm working with another developer on a project, and we're using Github as our remote repo. I'm on a Mac using git 1.7.7.3, he's on Windows using git 1.7.6.
This is what's happening

* One of us (let's call him developer A, but it doesn't matter which one) pushes a set of commits to GitHub.
* The other (developer B) makes some local commits.
* B does a ```git pull```.
* B does a ```git push```.
* Looking at the commit history log, I see Merge branch 'master' of github.com:foo/bar

The commit log gets littered with ""Merge branch"" messages over time, and also shows developer B as committing changes that developer A made. The only way we've found to prevent this issue has been to do a ```git pull --rebase``` at step 3, but I don't know what side effects rebasing will introduce. This is my first time working on a multi-developer git repo, so is this just normal behavior? Any thoughts on how to solve this issue?"

0;"Here are a few paragraphs that I took out of Wikipedia:
* The Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the Mario series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually Piranha Plants, and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in the New Super Mario Bros. series). In early Mario games such as Super Mario Bros., special, well-hidden areas known as Warp Zones contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.[19] In the New Super Mario Bros. series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. Cannons appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with Super Mario 64. The character uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming themself and being fired at a distant target. This allows the character to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas.
* Much of the supporting cast was introduced in the succeeding games for the Genesis and its add-ons. Sonic 2 introduced Sonic's sidekick Miles ""Tails"" Prower, a fox who can fly using his two tails.[208] Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose, a pink hedgehog and Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend, and Metal Sonic, a robotic doppelgÃ¤nger of Sonic created by Eggman.[209] Sonic 3 introduced Sonic's rival Knuckles, a red echidna and the guardian of the Master Emerald.[210] The Master Emerald, introduced in Sonic & Knuckles,[211] controls the power of the Chaos Emeralds.[201] Knuckles' Chaotix introduced the Chaotix, a group comprising Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee.[212] A number of characters introduced during this period, such as Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel from SegaSonic the Hedgehog and Fang the Sniper from Sonic Triple Trouble (1994), faded into obscurity, although they sometimes reappear.[38][213]
* Some Easter eggs originated from in-jokes between members of the development team. One example is ""Toasty"", which found its way into the game in the form of a small image of sound designer Dan Forden, who would appear in the corner of the screen during gameplay (after performing an uppercut) and yell the phrase ""Toasty!"", originating from him saying ""you're toast"".[45] This egg was also the key to unlocking the hidden character Smoke when it happened in the Portal stage in Mortal Kombat II.[42] In Mortal Kombat 4, Forden would say ""Toasty! 3D!"" after Scorpion did his burn Fatality, a reference to the fact that it is the first 3D game of the series.[46] ""Toasty!"" is also found in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, appearing randomly after the character pulls off a chain of hits, though the picture of Forden was removed for that title,[47] but brought back for the 2011 Mortal Kombat game. Yet another private joke was the hidden character Noob Saibot, who has appeared in various versions of the game starting with Mortal Kombat II. The character's name derived from two of the series' creators' surnames, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled backwards.[48] In addition, a counter for ERMACS on the game's audits screen (ERMACS being short for error macros), was interpreted by some players as a reference to a hidden character in the original Mortal Kombat. The development team decided to turn the rumor into reality, introducing Ermac in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 as an unlockable secret character.[49][50] The hidden character Mokap, introduced in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, is a tribute to Carlos Pesina, who played Raiden in MK and MKII and has served as a motion capture actor for subsequent titles in the series.[51]

One theme in my story is that the metric system (i.e. the âInternational System of Unitsâ/SI units) is officially and widely used in the United States (in everyday life, not just in science).
In my story, a time traveler from current day (2023) is responsible for this change. In addition, I want to base this change on real-world events, and I donât want this part to be very long.

How could my time traveler cause the US to use the metric system?

Before you answer, here are additional constraints from my story that I need your answer to take into account:
*  The travelâs time machine has just enough energy left for a single back and forth trip.
*  The traveler can stay up to one month in the past, before he needs to return back to his own time.
*  The traveler needs to get back alive. Therefore, it is highly preferable that the traveler wonât risk his life.
*  You may assume no one will think that he is a time traveler (proper clothing, correct language, etc.)
*  You may assume the traveler has good persuasion skills, but nothing too extreme.
*  Other historical consequences donât matter much. As long as there is a large country in North America that is recognized as the United States, and that country uses the metric system, Iâm good."

However, it (1) lacks few-shot domain adaptation methods as baselines, e.g. Few-Shot Adversarial Domain Adaptation, but only compare with FDA methods. (2) The evaluation metric they use is only the SER. As the application research article, the performance of the proposed method in practical communication problems is essential.

The story follows a young teacher, Pat Conroy (played by Jon Voight), in 1969 assigned to isolated ""Yamacraw Island"" (Daufuskie Island) off the coast of South Carolina and populated mostly by poor black families. He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with ""Conrack"" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world.
Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about ""what death would sound like.""  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of ""the river"". As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.  As he is about to leave by boat, one of the students then begins playing a record, which is the beginning movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

When journalist Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's rapidly growing, yet unregulated, gestational surrogacy industry for HBO documentary series Vice, she didn't anticipate 'how dark' the story would get.

For nearly two years, the producer and host has been reporting on current issues across the globe and has covered everything from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay to the effect of climate change on polar bears - but nothing could have prepared her for the moment when someone offered to sell her a baby over dinner while she was working undercover in India. 

'It was the most heartbreaking experience that I ever had,' Gianna told Daily Mail Online.  

Baby business: Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni (pictured) traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry 

Shady deal: The journalist from Brooklyn, New York, went undercover to meet with an agent in India who offered to get her a baby in two to three months

But the heartbreak did not end there.

As Gianna quickly learned during her time working on the Outsourcing Embryos documentary, surrogacy in India is a multi-million dollar business, and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of American couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the 'embryo outsourcing' agencies featured in the Vice documentary.

During her time spent undercover posing as one of these people, Gianna was informed that, in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product, doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates, which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies.

And if an 'extra' baby is born, it isn't necessarily going home with its genetic parents. There are also issues with couples never making it to India to claim their children for whatever reasons, meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent. 

For the most recent episode in the Vice series, Gianna went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a Caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact 'extra' babies being sold on the black market.

The agent then tried to convince Gianna and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant.

Shocking offer: One of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them

No morals: The agent eventually offered to sell Gianna and her team the baby over dinner 

Gianna noted that the agent spoke with a 'shocking amount of ease' and 'talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner.

'It made me think it wasn't a one-off thing,' she explained to Daily Mail Online. 

Gianna never once considered buying the baby, but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother, she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer, knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise, particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody.

'When I go on these stories, I am a human being first and a journalist second,' she said of her initial reaction to the offer.

The sale of 'extra' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by Gianna and her team.

In the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000, and Gianna explained that 'the reoccurring theme' when speaking with American agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money.

Commercial surrogacy in India costs nearly one-sixth the amount it would in the Western World.

'That seems to be the main driver,' she explained, before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element.

No options: Many of the surrogates who spoke with Gianna said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money 

Dormitory: The women who agree to be surrogates at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth

Tight quarters: Two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room 

And while American parents see the surrogacy business in India as being a 'cheap' alternative to the services offered at home, the amount of money made by a surrogate in India can vastly change her life, as well as the life of her family.  

Women can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school, and Gianna explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives.

But there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they can't read, only to be duped out of the money they were promised.

When I go on these stories I am a human being first and a journalist second

Surrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day.

Gianna, who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic, in the town of Gujarat, in the west of India, was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate's C-section.

Dr Patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in any other profession.

And while Gianna explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate, the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they didn't have any other options.   

During the episode, a surrogate named Vasanti told Gianna: 'Nobody likes doing this.' 

Dishonest: Although Dr Patel maintained that she didn't search for surrogates from the slums, Gianna met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area 

No choice: A doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates. Surrogates have to undergo C-sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day 

Too quick: Almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate, the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country 

She continued: 'I didn't have a home, so I thought I could build one by being a surrogate.'

Another surrogate named Nisha explained that she was 'helpless' and had 'no alternatives'.

Gianna was overcome by many of the surrogates' desperation.

'It is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body, that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive,' she said.

Gianna recalled speaking with one surrogate's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate.

He made clear that he didn't force her into the role, but explained that it was necessary for their family's survival.

'It all went back to money,' Gianna noted.

As a whole, Gianna said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the 'shadier side' of commercialized surrogacy, but a 'vast majority' have no idea this dark underbelly exits.

Gianna recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent, the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with."

One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is

(A)admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.

Article: The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to about 750 nanometers. In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 400â790 terahertz. These boundaries are not sharply defined and may vary per individual. Under optimal conditions these limits of human perception can extend to 310 nm (ultraviolet) and 1100 nm (near infrared). The optical spectrum is sometimes considered to be the same as the visible spectrum, but some authors define the term more broadly, to include the ultraviolet and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum as well.

In physics, gravity (from Latin gravitas 'weight') is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy [clarification needed]. Gravity is, by far, the weakest of the four fundamental interactions, approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong interaction, 1036 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 1029 times weaker than the weak interaction. As a result, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles. However, gravity is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light.

Prince William had left pregnant Kate and son George in London while he undertook a week-long tour of the Far East.

His visit to China was one of the most high-profile â and diplomatically sensitive â tours of his fledgling royal career.

With China on course to overtake the United States as the world's largest economy, the UK government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and William's visit was seen as a key part of those efforts.

Stepping foot for the first time on Chinese soil, the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the Royal family to visit the country since the Queen nearly 30 years ago.

The Duke, pictured with Chinese deputy president Li Yuanchao, was asked to pass on an invitation to visit to the Queen. His visit to China was one of the most high-profile â and diplomatically sensitive â tours of his fledgling royal career

Meanwhile in London the Duchess of Cambridge's lunchtime event at the hotel was not part of her official schedule and, according to Kensington Palace, the 33-year-old was attending in a private capacity, having received a personal invitation from the hotel.

Kate obviously has fond memories of the property situated opposite Buckingham Palace after spending her last night as a single woman and non-Royal there with her parents and siblings Pippa, 31 and James, 27. She also visited the hotel last December for a meeting of the board of the 1851 Trust, the sailing charity of which she is patron.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region."

Although the story didnât cite the cost of appendectomy â emergency or urgent surgery â and we wish it had, we nonetheless will give it a satisfactory score because it at least cited what the editorial writer wrote, ""A secondary benefit is the savings to the hospital generated by minimizing staff and anesthesiologist presence late in the evening and during the wee hours of the morning."" As with our harms score above, although the story didnât give absolute numbers, in this case we think it was sufficient for it to report that ""The scientists found no significant difference among the groups in the patientsâ condition 30 days after surgery or in the length of their operation or hospital stay.""

Coxsackieviruses are enteric viruses that frequently infect humans. To examine coxsackievirus pathogenesis, we orally inoculated mice with the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy strain. Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, we noticed that some fecal viruses generated plaques >100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, N63Y, in the VP3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB3 and N63Y mutant CVB3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose was used in the overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wildtype CVB3 but not by N63Y mutant CVB3. Furthermore, N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB3 did. While N63Y mutant CVB3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice. Infection with N63Y mutant CVB3 induced more severe hepatic damage than infection with wild-type CVB3, likely because N63Y mutant CVB3 disseminates more efficiently to the liver. Our data reinforce the idea that culture-adapted laboratory virus strains can have reduced fitness in vivo. N63Y mutant CVB3 may be useful as a platform to understand viral adaptation and pathogenesis in animal studies. IMPORTANCE Coxsackieviruses frequently infect humans, and although many infections are mild or asymptomatic, there can be severe outcomes, including heart inflammation. Most studies with coxsackieviruses and other viruses use laboratory-adapted viral strains because of their efficient replication in cell culture. We used a cell culture-adapted strain of CVB3, Nancy, to examine viral replication and pathogenesis in orally inoculated mice. We found that mice shed viruses distinct from input viruses because they formed extremely large plaques in cell culture. We identified a single mutation, VP3 N63Y, that was sufficient for large-plaque formation. N63Y mutant viruses have reduced glycan binding and replication in cell culture; however, they have enhanced replication and virulence in mice. We are now using N63Y mutant CVB3 as an improved system for viral pathogenesis studies. Citation Wang Y, Pfeiffer JK. 2016.

But I have some serious concerns about long term viability. One concerns parents. My parents, upon learning that we were a thing, said, ""remember, you are her ticket to stay in America."" Her parents, upon learning that we were a real thing, wanted to know how much money I make (I'm a grad student), and wanted to make sure I was OK with their tradition of supporting parents in their retirement as a sign of respect (despite that they are well off enough to not need such help). GF is in agreement with her folks about this and says if I am not OK with it she will just have to make more money and do it herself. Also, GF says her parents could 'never know' that I was previously married and am now divorced. 

There are some other issues as well that I've been able to overcome/overlook (one example, she's not social, I am), but their combination makes me feel that a future with her is risky with lots of prior indications of trouble ahead. In my previous marriage I ignored those kinds of signs and paid a price for it, and I'm not wanting to repeat that history. At the same time, it is really nice to have a partner who is on board with me sexually whom I also get along with pretty well.

Change is coming to Ferguson. In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination.

It should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change?

The report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time.

Court costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, ""a collection agency"" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents.

The evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were ""no racial issues"" in his department.

Ferguson's ugly, racist emails released

The recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.)

Without question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black.

Ferguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest.

Jackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson.

But does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department.

Indeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process.

Equally important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns..

The Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department.

But there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States.

That form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance.

In any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country.

Likewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do.

It's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high.

Ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population.

Change is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town."

Former pub landlord Michael Thorpe has had his conviction for illegally showing foreign footage of Premier League games overturned after eight years

A pub landlord convicted of showing Premier League football matches on foreign TV channels has won an eight-year legal battle to clear his name.

Michael Thorpe says he has paid a heavy price for the lengthy fight to get his conviction quashed and has lost his pub as a result.

Mr Thorpe, 55, was convicted of showing a Premier League game without having an agreement with official broadcasters in November 2006 at the Stoke Inn in Plymouth, Devon.

He said he could not afford to pay Sky TV's rates for football matches, and opted instead to show Albanian transmissions of matches, which he says he thought was legal.

But he was convicted, fined and ordered to pay costs eight years ago, when screening the matches was still treated as a criminal offence.

Judge Recorder Nicolas Gerasimidis has now upheld his appeal and overturned the conviction following a landmark European court ruling.

His appeal took so long as he had to launch the case  after the European Court of Justice found enforcing previous rules was anti-competitive.

Mr Thorpe said he was 'overwhelmed' that a judge and magistrates had upheld his appeal after all this time.

But it is a bitter-sweet victory, as the long-running dispute cost him his business and his livelihood.

He said: 'We put a lot of money into that pub and it went from a thriving business to absolutely zero. People stopped coming to the pub, it cost me my business.'

Mr Thorpe launched an appeal against his conviction soon after his trial, but the case was delayed by a similar test case which went as far as the European Court of Justice.

The court ruled that having an exclusive system was a restraint of free trade and contrary to European Law.

But the landlord says the court action has seen him lose the Stoke Inn in Plymouth which he used to run

Mr Thorpe's appeal was further delayed until another case involving Media Protection Services Ltd, the company which took him to court on behalf of the Premier League, but which no longer does so.

Mr Thorpe was awarded his legal costs, which he paid privately, but he would not disclose the sum.

The European court decision in 2012 cleared a landlady of a criminal conviction, but judges left the door open for court action against publicans by ruling pubs should get permission from the copyright owner before screening matches.

The Premier League has since been taking landlords to civil courts for breaching copyright, with some ordered to pay up to Â£65,000 in costs.

The league sends teams of investigators to pubs around the country to try and catch those screening games illegally. Legal cases have  been brought against 250 bars and pubs during the current football season.

He said he does not know whether he can retrieve the Â£1,000 fine and Â£1,500 costs ordered by the magistrates.

Despite the decision, the Premier League has insisted pubs still cannot show foreign-TV footage of its games.

Since the European Court decision, it is taking landlords to civil courts and suing them using copyright laws, which were not affected by the previous ruling.

In 2012, pub Karen Murphy landlady won a landmark legal battle to overturn her conviction for using foreign decoders instead of Sky to show Premier League football matches.

Ms Murphy, who ran The Red, White and Blue pub in Portsmouth, Hampshire, bought games through a Greek satellite broadcaster Nova for Â£800 a year instead of Sky, which was then priced at Â£700-a-month.

The Premier League took legal action against her Mrs Murphy and she was fined Â£8,000 for dishonest reception of a television reception in 2006.

But a European Court of Justice ruling said having an exclusive system of TV rights was contrary to EU law and the High Court overturned her conviction.

A recent investigation by trade publication, The Morning Advertiser, quoted a pub landlord saying Sky Sports cost him Â£16,000-a-year, compared to the Â£300-per-year of screening it illegally.

The decision came after Portsmouth landlady Karen Murphy won a European court battle over her conviction. Despite the ruling, the Premier League can still take pub owners to civil courts over breach of copyright"

0;"Most of the books I read give examples using <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>. At some point the students know perfectly how to use these two functions but they don't know about <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code> and <code>argv</code>. 
To me and according to many programming principles (e.g. KISS) a program should not interrupt the execution for prompting the user. Instead, and this is a much clever approach, the developer should learn to use the power of pipes and use the options and the arguments. 
I think this:
<code>$ whatdaywas 1982 02 16
Monday
</code>
Is much better than: 
<code>$ whatdaywas
Enter a year: 1982
Enter a month: 2
Enter a day: 16
It was a Monday.

I was wondering whether these pervasive problems go away, when one is doing mathematics research?
